# R-code from the paper "Optimizing the case-crossover design for use in shared exposure settings"

This code will create data on Legionnaires' disease and meteorological variables by three different scenarios:
1. 01: Random events, unaltered exposures
2. 10: Unaltered events, random exposures
3. M1: Event probabilities modelled by exposure values

The results of the different simulations run can be aggregated and presented using the "Results_presentation"-scripts
